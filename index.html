                <li>Little Red River</li>
                    <p>The Little Red River is my favorite river for fishing brown trout. The brown trout spawn in early December 
                        which creates excellent fishing conditions. We typically catch rainbow trout in the size of 12" - 20" and brown trout 
                        15" - 24". There are a few times where we will be fortunate to catch a brown over 30" It has become a tradition to make a trip there yearly. 
                        This river is a tailwater system so there are times when the river is not wadeable. </p>

                <li>Pere Marquette River</li>
                    <p>The Pere Marquette River is one of the top rated fishery in the country. In the spring you can 
                        fish for Steelhead, in the summer you can fish for Brown Trout and in the fall you can fish for Salmon. It 
                        is an extremely technical river to fish. You need to be experienced in casting in tight places or it will 
                        not be a fun experience. However, once you master the casting it will be one of the best fishing experice one can have. 
                        Hooking into a 25lb salmon gives quite the rush." </p>

                <li>Little Sugar Creek</li>
                    <p>Also know as the Lil Sug, this little creek is great for bass fishing during the hottest months of the summer. This is 
                        a fun creek to fish. We fish in our swim suit and sandals so if we get too hot we simple swim in the creek to cool off. 
                        The bass are usually always bitting so there is lot of action. It is simple fishing, you just need a rubber worm, hook 
                        and sinker. It's a great creek to teach young kids how to fish.</p>

                    <p>These pictures were taken at Tanyard Creek, this is a great place for a shourt hike. I believe it's about 
                        a 3 mile loop. I have my adventure partner, my wife, with me here. We have found Arkansas has a tremendous 
                        amount of hiking options. I would recommend this hike after a good rain as there are multiple waterfalls 
                        along the trail. This trail does get a lot of traffic so it is recommended to get there early. It is also 
                        very kid friendly as it is not very strenuous. </p>

                    <p>This is a trip I took in 2018 to Grandfather Mountain.This hike was about 8 miles out and back. It was extremely 
                        strenuous the last couple of miles getting to the top. There were many waterfalls along the way. It was a beautiful 
                        hike that took about 4 hours. I would recommend starting in the morning and keep an eye on the weather. You would 
                        not want to be caught out there during a storm.</p>
